Random Vector and Matrix Operations with Visualization <br/>
This repository contains Python code that demonstrates the creation of random vectors and matrices, performs mathematical operations on them, and visualizes the results using plots.

Description <br/>
Random Vectors Plot: Two random vectors, each containing 15 floats, are generated and plotted on the same graph.
Random Matrix Heatmap: A 4x4 matrix with random values is created and visualized as a heatmap using Seaborn.
Matrix Operations: Two 4x4 matrices are generated, and operations like addition, subtraction, and matrix multiplication (dot product) are performed. <br/>
Bar Plots for Results: The results of the matrix operations are visualized using bar plots.
